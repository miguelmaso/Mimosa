  journal = {Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering},

  volume = {193},
  pages = {2221--2237},
  abstract = {The robust design of structures with stochastic parameters is studied
	using optimization techniques. The first two
	
	statistical moments of the stochastic parameters including design
	variables are considered in conjunction with the
	
	second-order perturbation method for the approximation of mean value
	and variance of the structural response. In this
	
	framework, the sensitivities of the mean values and variances of the
	structural performance function with respect to the
	
	design variables are calculated for use in the optimization task.
	The robust design of structures is formulated as a multicriteria
	
	optimization problem, in which both the expected value and the standard
	deviation of the objective function are
	
	to be minimized. The robustness of the feasibility is also taken into
	account by involving the variability of the structural
	
	response in the constraints. The two-criteria optimization problem
	is converted into a scalar one and is then solved by a
	
	gradient based optimization algorithm. To demonstrate the applicability
	of the presented method, numerical examples
	
	are given, involving static and dynamic response.},
