\begin{abstract}
	

The aim of this paper is the design a new one-step implicit and thermodynamically consistent Energy-Momentum (EM) preserving time integration scheme for the simulation of thermo-elastic processes undergoing large deformations and temperature fields. Following \cite{Bonet_hyperbolicity_partIII_2019}, we consider well-posed constitutive models for the entire range of deformations and temperature. In that regard, the consideration of polyconvexity inspired constitutive models and a new tensor cross product algebra are shown to be crucial in order to derive the so-called discrete derivatives, fundamental for the construction of the algorithmic derived variables, namely the second Piola-Kirchoff stress tensor and the entropy (or the absolute temperature). The proposed scheme inherits the advantages of the EM scheme recently published by Franke et al. \cite{Betsch2018Thermo}, %\Blue{which eliminates typical artificial contributions for the algorithmic stress formula \cite{Hesch_Betsch_EM_thermo_2011}, needed to restore energy consistency in the discrete setting,} 
whilst resulting in a simpler scheme from the implementation standpoint.
%
%(i.e. consistency, stability, conservation) whilst resulting in dramatically far simpler algorithmic expressions, thus circumventing a bottleneck and paving the way for the incorporation of further physics into the model
%
A series of numerical examples will be presented in order to demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the new EM scheme. Although the examples presented will make use of a temperature-based version of the EM scheme (using the Helmholtz free energy as the thermodynamical potential and the temperature as the thermodynamical state variable), we also include in an Appendix an entropy-based analogue EM scheme (using the internal energy as the thermodynamical potential and the entropy as the thermodynamical state variable).   






%The proposed EM scheme is inspired by the previous EM scheme published by Betsch et. al. \cite{Betsch_EM_thermo_2017}, whereby taking advantage of the concept of polyconvexity \cite{Ball_1976,Ball_1976_2,Ball_2002,Ball_Murat_1976,Schroderbook}, and extended system of (four) greatly simplified discrete derivatives is proposed. Although the formulation in \cite{Betsch_EM_thermo_2017} is based on temperature, it relies on the definition of the internal energy functional re-expressed in terms of temperature. %This introduces a certain complexity in the formulation (more specifically, in its consistent linearisation) that the present paper aims to minimise. 
%We present two possible EM schemes, based on  temperature or entropy as the thermodynamic state variable. With that in mind, we use for each scheme the consistent energy functional, namely the Helmholtz free energy functional (for the temperature-based scheme) or the consistent Legendre transformed internal energy  functional (for the entropy-based scheme), respectively. Only the finite element implementation of the temperature-based scheme is pursued in this paper. The design of the entropy-based scheme can be found in \ref{sec:entropy-based formulation}. Finally, the paper presents a series of numerical examples to demonstrate the stability and conservation properties of the proposed temperature-based EM scheme.
